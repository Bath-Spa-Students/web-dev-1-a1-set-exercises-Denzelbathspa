            <ol type="1">
                <li>Start by cooking the rice according to package instructions. For best results, use leftover rice that has been refrigerated for at least a few hours.</li>
                <li>Heat a large skillet or wok over medium-high heat. Add a small amount of oil and swirl to coat the pan.</li>
                <li>Add minced garlic to the pan and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds.</li>
                <li>Push the garlic to one side of the pan and crack the eggs into the empty space. Scramble the eggs until they are fully cooked.</li>
                <li>Add diced onions and any other desired vegetables to the pan. Stir-fry until the vegetables are tender-crisp.</li>
                <li>Add the cooked rice to the pan, breaking up any clumps with a spatula. Stir-fry the rice with the vegetables until heated through.</li>
                <li>Drizzle oyster sauce over the rice and stir to combine. Cook for an additional 1-2 minutes to allow the flavors to meld.</li>
                <li>Finally, add diced luncheon meat or any other desired protein to the pan. Cook until heated through.</li>
                <li>Remove the pan from heat and serve the fried rice hot, garnished with chopped green onions or cilantro if desired. Enjoy!</li>
